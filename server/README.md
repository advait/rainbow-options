<div align="center">Minimal starter kit for a flexible GraphQL server for TypeScript - based on best practices from the GraphQL community.</div>

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Simple Hello World example:** Where it either returns `Hello <name>!` or `Hello World!` if no name argument is provided.
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `typescript-basic` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate typescript-minimal

# 2. Run yarn install or npm install

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev
```
